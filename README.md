## Local Installation

Make sure you have an existing MySQL database installed

1. git clone
2. npm install
3. npm run db:migrate to create database
3. somehow seed table?
4. run dev?

```
Since sequelize-cli is not installed globally, commands should be run using `npx sequelize [command]`, assuming npm@5.2.0 and above has been installed globally.
